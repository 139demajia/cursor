This is an issues-only repo for **[Cursor](https://cursor.so), an editor made for programming with AI.** It's early days, but right now Cursor can help you with a few things...

-   **Chat**: Talk with a ChatGPT-like bot that sees your current file
-   **Edit**: Ask the AI to change a block of code, see an inline diff of the edits
-   **Debug**: Hover over linter errors to auto-fix them
-   **Write**: Generate entire codebases from short English descriptions

## Getting Started

Head over to [our website](https://cursor.so/) to download and try out the editor.

## Contributing

We appreciate any and all feedback üôÇ Our goal is to make Cursor work great for you

Feel free to file tickets for bugs or feature requests. You can upvote üëç the ones you'd like us to prioritize.

## Roadmap

Long term, our plan is to build Cursor into the world's most productive development environment. Using LLMs, we want to do things like:

-   "Heal" your repository when you're halfway through a refactor
-   Allow you to code by editing a "pseudocode" version of your codebase
-   Auto-fix errors as soon as they show up in your terminal
-   Embed AI-written documentation into the UI

## OSS

We'd previously open-sourced our old Codemirror-based editor. You can find that code [here](https://github.com/getcursor/cursor-codemirror). The newest versions of Cursor are not yet open-source; if you'd much prefer we open-source the editor, feel free to reach out to admin@cursor.so.
